            <h2>NIDRA: Neural Inferencer for Deep Rest Analysis</h2>
            <p>Advanced neural networks can perform highly accurate sleep scoring, but these technologies are often difficult to implement.</p>
            <p>NIDRA is a fool-proof, simple-to-use tool for scoring sleep recordings using the best currently available autoscoring machine learning algorithms. No programming required, but a CLI and python endpoints are available.</p>
            <p>NIDRA can autoscore data from polysomnography (PSG) recordings, as well as from sleep EEG wearables (such as ZMax).</p>
            <p>NIDRA enables anyone, including researchers without any programming experience, to use cutting-edge sleep scoring models.</p>
            <p>NIDRA by default uses the highly accurate U-Sleep 2.0 model for PSG, and the recently validated high-accuracy ez6 and ez6moe sleep scoring models for ZMax data and simliar sleep EEG wearables. For a validation of the ez models see <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.02.657451v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.02.657451v1</a></p>

                <li><strong><a href="LINK">Download for Windows</a></strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>2. Install from PyPI</h4>
            <p>Alternatively, NIDRA can be installed as a Python package using pip. This requires Python 3.10 or later.</p>
            <pre><code>pip install nidra</code></pre>
            <p>Once installed, you can launch the graphical interface by running the <code>nidra</code> command in your terminal.</p>
            <p>For advanced users who wish to install the package directly from the source code, please see the <a href="#install-from-source">Install from Source</a> section.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="gui-guide">
            <h2>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h2>
            <p>The GUI provides an intuitive, point-and-click way to score sleep recordings. The easiest way to launch the GUI is by running the standalone executable. If you installed NIDRA as a package, you can launch it by opening your terminal and running the command: <code>nidra</code></p>

                <li><strong>Model</strong>: Select the appropriate model for your data source.</li>
                <li><strong>Options</strong>: Choose whether to generate plots and statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>Run</strong>: Start the scoring process.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>A more detailed walkthrough is provided in the sections below.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="preparing-data">
            <h2>Preparing Your Data for NIDRA</h2>
            <p>For NIDRA to process your recordings correctly, your files and folders must be organized in a specific way. Please follow these guidelines to avoid errors.</p>
            <h3>General Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File Format:</strong> NIDRA exclusively works with European Data Format (.edf) files.</li>
                <li><strong>Channel Labels:</strong> Ensure your EDF files have standard channel labels (e.g., 'EEG Fpz-Cz', 'EOG left') for PSG data, as NIDRA uses these to identify the correct signals.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Data Structure Guide</h3>
            <p>Whether you are scoring a single file or batch processing, NIDRA expects each recording session to be in its own folder. When using the "Score all subdirectories" mode, NIDRA will treat every subfolder in your input directory as a separate recording.</p>
            <p><strong>Structure for Forehead EEG (e.g., ZMax):</strong></p>
            <p>For two-channel forehead EEG data, the left and right channel files must be in the same directory. For ZMax data, these are typically named <code>EEG_L.edf</code> and <code>EEG_R.edf</code>.</p>
            <pre>
forehead_study/
└── subject_01/
    ├── EEG_L.edf
    └── EEG_R.edf
</pre>
            <p><strong>Structure for PSG:</strong></p>
            <p>For PSG data, each EDF file should be in its own directory. NIDRA can process multiple recordings in subdirectories, as shown in this example with three recordings:</p>
            <pre>
psg_study/
├── subject_02/
|   └── night_recording_1.edf
├── subject_03/
|   └── night_recording_2.edf
└── subject_04/
    └── another_night.edf
</pre>

        <section id="gui-walkthrough">
            <h2>GUI Guide: A Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>
            <p>This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of how to score a sleep recording using the NIDRA graphical interface, from launching the application to interpreting your results.</p>
            <h3>Step 1: Launching the Application</h3>
            <p>The easiest way is to double-click the standalone executable file you downloaded. Alternatively, if you installed NIDRA as a package, open your terminal and type <code>nidra</code>, then press Enter. The main application window will appear.</p>
            <h3>Step 2: Setting Input and Output Paths</h3>
            <p>Your first step is to tell NIDRA where your data is and where the results should go.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Input Directory:</strong> Click the "Browse files..." button. A file dialog will open. Navigate to and select the folder that contains your sleep recording file(s). For batch processing, this would be your main project folder containing subdirectories for each subject.</li>
                <li><strong>Output Directory:</strong> Specify the folder where NIDRA will save the scoring results. If you leave this blank, NIDRA will automatically create a new folder named <code>autoscorer_output</code> inside your input directory. This is the recommended approach for keeping your data and results organized.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 3: Configuring the Scoring Mode</h3>
            <p>NIDRA offers two modes for processing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Score single recording:</strong> Choose this if the folder you selected as your input contains the files for only one sleep session.</li>
                <li><strong>Score all recordings (in subfolders):</strong> Choose this for batch processing. NIDRA will look for subdirectories within your selected input folder and process each one as a separate recording.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 4: Selecting the Data Source and Model</h3>
            <p>This is a critical step to ensure high-quality scoring.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Source:</strong> Select the type of recording you have. Choose "Forehead EEG" for 2-channel wearable data or "PSG" for standard polysomnography data.</li>
                <li><strong>Model:</strong> The available models will change based on your data source. For forehead EEG, <code>ez6moe</code> is recommended for its high accuracy. For PSG, <code>u-sleep-nsrr-2024</code> is the standard choice.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Step 5: Running the Analysis and Monitoring Progress</h3>
            <p>Before starting, you can choose to generate plots and sleep statistics using the checkboxes. It is highly recommended to keep these enabled. Click the <strong>"Run NIDRA autoscoring"</strong> button to begin. The button will be disabled and read "Running..." during processing. You can monitor the real-time progress in the console panel on the right. This log will show which files are being processed and report any warnings or errors.</p>

        <section id="model-performance">
            <h2>Model Validation and Performance</h2>
            <p>The models included in NIDRA have been rigorously validated against manually scored data from human experts. Below is a summary of their performance.</p>
            <h3>ez6 and ez6moe for Forehead EEG</h3>
            <p>The <code>ez6moe</code> model was validated against expert-scored PSG recordings. The confusion matrix below shows the model's predictions (y-axis) versus the expert labels (x-axis). The diagonal represents correct classifications. As you can see, the model shows high agreement with the expert scorer, particularly for Wake, N2, and REM sleep.</p>
            <img src="matrix.png" alt="Confusion matrix of the ez6moe model" style="width: 60%; max-width: 600px; display: block; margin: 20px 0;">
            <p><b>Fig.2</b> - Confusion matrix (vs. manually scored PSG) of the artefact-aware ez6moe model.</p>
            <p>Key performance metrics, such as accuracy and Cohen's Kappa (a measure of inter-rater agreement), are comparable to the agreement levels seen between different human experts. For full details, please refer to the original publication.</p>
            <h3>U-Sleep for PSG</h3>
            <p>The U-Sleep model is a well-established, state-of-the-art algorithm for PSG sleep scoring. The version used in NIDRA (<code>u-sleep-nsrr-2024</code>) is a robust implementation trained on a large dataset. It demonstrates high performance across diverse populations and recording conditions. For detailed performance metrics, please see the original U-Sleep and SLEEPYLAND publications linked in the Attribution section.</p>

        <section id="understanding-results">
            <h2>Understanding Your Results</h2>
            <p>Once NIDRA has finished processing, you will find several output files in your specified output directory. Here's what they are and how to use them.</p>
            <h3>The Output Files</h3>
            <p>For each recording, NIDRA generates up to four files:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hypnogram File (<code>hypnogram.txt</code>):</strong> This is the main output. It's a text file with a single column of numbers, where each number is the sleep stage for one 30-second epoch.</li>
                <li><strong>Probabilities File (<code>probabilities.txt</code>):</strong> This file contains the raw probabilities for each sleep stage for every epoch. Each row corresponds to an epoch, and each column corresponds to a sleep stage (Wake, N1, N2, N3, Artifact, REM). This is useful for advanced analysis of model confidence.</li>
                <li><strong>Hypnogram Plot (<code>hypnogram.png</code>):</strong> An image that visualizes the hypnogram, showing the progression of sleep stages over the night.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep Statistics (<code>sleep_statistics.csv</code>):</strong> A CSV file with a detailed summary of sleep metrics like Total Sleep Time, Sleep Efficiency, and time spent in each stage.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Sleep Stage Key</h3>
            <p>The hypnogram uses the following standard numeric codes for sleep stages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>0:</strong> Wake</li>
                <li><strong>1:</strong> N1 Sleep (Light Sleep)</li>
                <li><strong>2:</strong> N2 Sleep</li>
                <li><strong>3:</strong> N3 Sleep (Deep Sleep)</li>
                <li><strong>5:</strong> REM Sleep</li>
                <li><strong>6:</strong> Artifact</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="cli-guide">
            <h2>CLI Guide: Automating Scoring</h2>
            <p>The Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful feature for processing large datasets and integrating NIDRA into automated workflows.</p>
            <h3>Basic Command Structure</h3>
            <p>The fundamental command is <code>nidra score</code>. You must provide the input path, output directory, and the type of scorer.</p>
            <pre><code>nidra score --input_path /path/to/data --output_dir /path/to/output --scorer_type forehead</code></pre>
            <h3>Example: Batch Processing a Full Study</h3>
            <p>Let's say you have a study with data structured as recommended in the "Preparing Your Data" section. You can process all subjects with a single command by pointing the <code>--input_path</code> to the main study directory.</p>
            <pre><code>nidra score --input_path /my_study_data/ --output_dir /my_study_results/ --scorer_type forehead --model_name ez6moe</code></pre>
            <p>NIDRA will automatically find the subdirectories (subject_01, subject_02, etc.), process each one, and place the results in a correspondingly named folder inside <code>/my_study_results/</code>.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="python-package">
            <h2>Python Package: Advanced Integration</h2>
            <p>Using NIDRA as a Python package provides the ultimate flexibility, allowing you to integrate automated scoring directly into your data analysis pipelines.</p>
            <h3>Core Concept: The Scorer Object</h3>
            <p>The main entry point is the <code>NIDRA.scorer</code> class. You first create an instance of this class, providing it with the configuration for your scoring task. Then, you call the <code>.score()</code> method on the instance to run the analysis.</p>
            <h4><code>NIDRA.scorer(...)</code> Parameters</h4>
            <p>When initializing a scorer, you must provide the following arguments:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>scorer_type</code> (str): The type of data. Must be either <code>'forehead'</code> or <code>'psg'</code>.</li>
                <li><code>input_file</code> (str): The full path to the input EDF file. For forehead EEG, this should be the path to the left channel file (e.g., ending in <code>_L.edf</code> or named <code>EEG_L.edf</code>).</li>
                <li><code>output_dir</code> (str): The path to the directory where results will be saved.</li>
                <li><code>model_name</code> (str, optional): The name of the model to use. If not provided, a default model will be selected based on the <code>scorer_type</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><code>scorer.score(...)</code> Method</h4>
            <p>This method runs the scoring process. It takes one optional argument:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>plot</code> (bool, optional): If <code>True</code>, a hypnogram plot will be generated. Defaults to <code>True</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Returns:</strong></p>
            <p>The method returns a tuple containing two elements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>hypnogram</strong> (<code>numpy.ndarray</code>): A 1D array of integers representing the sleep stage for each 30-second epoch. See the <a href="#understanding-results">Sleep Stage Key</a> for the meaning of each integer.</li>
                <li><strong>probabilities</strong> (<code>numpy.ndarray</code>): A 2D array of shape (n_epochs, n_classes). Each row corresponds to an epoch, and each column contains the model's predicted probability for a specific sleep stage. The order of classes is Wake, N1, N2, N3, REM, Artifact.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Example: Batch Processing and Analyzing Statistics with Pandas</h3>
            <p>This example demonstrates a more realistic workflow: looping through a directory of subjects, scoring each one, and aggregating the sleep statistics into a single pandas DataFrame.</p>
            <pre>
import NIDRA
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd

# --- Setup ---
base_dir = Path('my_study_data/')
subjects = [p for p in base_dir.iterdir() if p.is_dir()]
all_stats = []

# --- Loop through subjects and score ---
for subject_dir in subjects:
    print(f"Processing {subject_dir.name}...")
    
    # Assume forehead EEG data with an _L.edf file
    input_file = next(subject_dir.glob('*_L.edf'))
    output_dir = subject_dir / 'py_output'
    
    # Initialize and run the scorer
    scorer = NIDRA.scorer(
        scorer_type='forehead',
        input_file=str(input_file),
        output_dir=str(output_dir),
        model_name='ez6moe'
    )
    hypnogram, probabilities = scorer.score(plot=True)
    
    # The scorer automatically saves the stats, we just need to load it
    stats_file = output_dir / 'sleep_statistics.csv'
    if stats_file.exists():
        stats = pd.read_csv(stats_file)
        stats['subject_id'] = subject_dir.name
        all_stats.append(stats)

# --- Aggregate results ---
if all_stats:
    final_dataframe = pd.concat(all_stats, ignore_index=True)
    final_dataframe.to_csv(base_dir / 'study_summary_statistics.csv')
    print("Processing complete. Summary statistics saved.")
</pre>
            <h3>Accessing Raw Probabilities</h3>
            <p>The <code>.score()</code> method also returns a <code>probabilities</code> object. This is a NumPy array of shape (n_epochs, n_classes), containing the raw probability for each sleep stage for every epoch. This is useful for advanced analyses, such as assessing model confidence or performing your own classification based on a different probability threshold.</p>

            <h2>FAQ & Troubleshooting</h2>
            <h3>Installation Issues</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: I'm having trouble installing with pip. What can I do?</strong><br>
            A: Ensure you are using a recent version of Python (3.10+) and pip. It is highly recommended to install NIDRA in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts. Try running <code>pip install --upgrade pip</code> before installing NIDRA.</p>
            <h3>GUI Issues</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: The GUI window is not appearing when I run <code>nidra</code>.</strong><br>
            A: Check the terminal for any error messages. This could be due to a missing dependency. Try reinstalling NIDRA in a clean virtual environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: Why is the "Run" button greyed out?</strong><br>
            A: The "Run" button is disabled until you have selected a valid Input Directory.</p>
            <h3>Scoring Errors</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: I got an error about "missing channels" or "could not find required channels".</strong><br>
            A: This is a common error that occurs when the channel labels in your EDF file do not match what the model expects, or when you've selected the wrong "Data Source". For example, selecting "PSG" for a forehead EEG file will cause this error. Double-check your data source selection and ensure your EDF channel labels are standard.</p>
            <p><strong>Q: The scoring process is very slow.</strong><br>
            A: Sleep scoring is computationally intensive, but a typical overnight recording should take less than a minute on modern hardware. If it is taking much longer, ensure no other resource-heavy processes are running on your computer.</p>
            <h3>General Questions</h3>
            <p><strong>Q: Can I trust the results?</strong><br>
            A: The models in NIDRA are validated and perform at a level comparable to human experts. However, like any automated algorithm, they are not perfect. It is always good practice to visually inspect the generated hypnogram plot for any obvious anomalies, especially for noisy or unusual recordings.</p>
